### Approximate count distinct (LogLogBeta) function demo

The DDL, dataset, and SQL demonstrate how to create, evaluate, and merge LogLogBeta approximations using Vertica built-in functions.  
These functions on "synopsis" objects are similar to the approximate count distinct functions provided by Apache datasketches HLL (HyperLogLog).

A blog post describing this content is coming soon.
